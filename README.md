## Introductions
This is my python code. With this code, you can:
  _ Understand simple model Sic-bo
  _ Can play Sic-bo without losing money ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
## Depscriptions:
  According to the rules of Sic-bo, We roll 3 dice (box with 6 side is 6 numbers from 1 to 6).
    If sum of 3 dice larger than 10, The result is "Tai"; smaller or equal 10 is "Xiu".
  This program use randrange to take random 3 dice. Moreover I provide to player amount of 
    money after each turn.
## Libaries that I used:
  _ Time
  _ Ramdom
