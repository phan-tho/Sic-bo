## Introductions

This is my python code. With this code, you can:
  - Understand simple model Sic-bo
  - Can play Sic-bo without losing money ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
## Depscriptions:
  According to the rules of Sic-bo, We roll 3 dice 
  (box with 6 side with 6 numbers from 1 to 6). 
  If sum of 3 dice larger than 10, The result is 
  "Tai"; smaller or equal 10 is "Xiu".This program 
  use randrange to take random 3 dice. Moreover I
  provide to player amount of money and update
  after each turn.
## Libaries that I used:
  - Time
  - Ramdom
